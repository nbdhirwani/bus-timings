In addition to the requirements described, I have made following assumptions
    1. First three letters of route variant are bus route numbers
    2. Route variant value will never be null, instead it will be "UNKNOWN"
    3. Logic for the derived field "Status" is as follows
        When deviationFromTimetable is null then Status is "Unknown" [color code "blueviolet"]
        Else When deviationFromTimetable is negative then Status is "Early" [color code "blue"]
        Else When deviationFromTimetable is between 0 and 300 then Status is "On Time" [color code "green"]
        Else When deviationFromTimetable is above 300 then Status is "Late" [color code "red"]
    4. The application is compatible with chrome. Support for other browsers is not guaranteed.
